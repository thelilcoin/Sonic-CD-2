# Sonic-CD-2
Sonic goes back to good ol' Little Planet and finds that the entire planet has lost its power to use Time Stones, as they are being held in Special Stages, and its bright charm. Some of the animals have been put into robots while the others have been put to work (Robotnik's Vision of Little Planet is basically to kidnap, enslave, turn the Planet to metal, and to colonize the rest of the world). Sonic, in a state of rage, speeds towards the planet to free the animals and save Little Planet...
